"The code starts from the 'main' function, where we take the input size of the queue. After that, the 1. 'add_element()' function is called to insert the element according to its need, and the data is printed. Then, the 2. 'remove_element()' function is called, allowing the user to remove the data according to their position, and the data is printed again. Finally, the 3.. 'find_element()' function is called, enabling the user to check whether a specific data or number is in the list or not. After that, the program returns 0."
